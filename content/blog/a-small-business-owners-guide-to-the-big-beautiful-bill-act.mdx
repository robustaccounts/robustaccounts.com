### In-Depth Look at the Key Provisions:

#### **Permanent Extension of the Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction**

One of the most significant components of the new law for small business owners is the permanent extension of the Section 199A Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction. This provision allows eligible pass-through entities—including sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs, and S corporations—to deduct up to 20% of their qualified business income. By making this deduction permanent, the bill provides long-term certainty and substantial tax relief, effectively lowering the taxable income for a vast number of small businesses.

#### **Enhanced Depreciation and Expensing Benefits**

To encourage business investment, the "Big Beautiful Bill Act" has made two key enhancements to depreciation and expensing rules:

* **Bonus Depreciation:** The bill permanently extends bonus depreciation at a 100% rate for qualifying property acquired after January 19, 2025. This allows businesses to deduct the full cost of eligible assets in the year of purchase rather than depreciating them over several years.
* **Section 179 Expensing:** The Section 179 expensing limit has been significantly increased, allowing small businesses to immediately deduct up to $2.5 million in qualifying property expenses. This is a powerful incentive for businesses to invest in new equipment and other assets.

#### **Expanded Employer Tax Credits**

The new law also provides significant support for small businesses through the permanent extension and expansion of several employer tax credits:

* **Employer Credit for Paid Family and Medical Leave:** This credit, which encourages businesses to offer paid leave to their employees, is now a permanent part of the tax code.
* **Employer-Provided Child Care Credit:** To help businesses support their employees with families, the credit percentage for employer-provided childcare has been increased from 25% to 40%. The maximum credit limit has also been raised to $500,000 (or $600,000 for eligible small businesses).

#### **Additional Provisions Benefiting Small Businesses**

The bill also makes Opportunity Zones a permanent feature of the tax landscape, offering continued investment opportunities for small businesses in designated economically-distressed communities.
